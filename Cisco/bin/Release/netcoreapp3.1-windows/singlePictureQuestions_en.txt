#47. Refer to the exhibit. If PC1 is sending a packet to PC2 and routing has been configured between the two routers, what will R1 do with the Ethernet frame header attached by PC1?
-nothing, because the router has a route to the destination network
-open the header and use it to determine whether the data is to be sent out S0/0/0
-open the header and replace the destination MAC address with a new one
+remove the Ethernet header and configure a new Layer 2 header before sending it out S0/0/0
#93. Refer to the exhibit. PC1 issues an ARP request because it needs to send a packet to PC2. In this scenario, what will happen next?
+PC2 will send an ARP reply with its MAC address.
-RT1 will send an ARP reply with its Fa0/0 MAC address.
-RT1 will send an ARP reply with the PC2 MAC address.
-SW1 will send an ARP reply with the PC2 MAC address.
-SW1 will send an ARP reply with its Fa0/1 MAC address
#110. Refer to the exhibit. What is wrong with the displayed termination?
-The woven copper braid should not have been removed.
-The wrong type of connector is being used.
+The untwisted length of each wire is too long.
-The wires are too thick for the connector that is used.
#119. Refer to the exhibit. The network administrator has assigned the LAN of LBMISS an address range of 192.168.10.0. This address range has been subnetted using a /29 prefix. In order to accommodate a new building, the technician has decided to use the fifth subnet for configuring the new network (subnet zero is the first subnet). By company policies, the router interface is always assigned the first usable host address and the workgroup server is given the last usable host address. Which configuration should be entered into the properties of the workgroup server to allow connectivity to the Internet?
-IP address: 192.168.10.65 subnet mask: 255.255.255.240, default gateway: 192.168.10.76

+IP address: 192.168.10.38 subnet mask: 255.255.255.248, default gateway: 192.168.10.33
-IP address: 192.168.10.41 subnet mask: 255.255.255.248, default gateway: 192.168.10.46
-IP address: 192.168.10.254 subnet mask: 255.255.255.0, default gateway: 192.168.10.1
#120. Refer to the exhibit. The switches are in their default configuration. Host A needs to communicate with host D, but host A does not have the MAC address for its default gateway. Which network hosts will receive the ARP request sent by host A?
-only host D
-only router R1
-only hosts A, B, and C
-only hosts A, B, C, and D
-only hosts B and C
+only hosts B, C, and router R1
#133. Refer to the exhibit. If Host1 were to transfer a file to the server, what layers of the TCP/IP model would be used?
-only application and Internet layers
-only Internet and network access layers
-only application, Internet, and network access layers
+application, transport, Internet, and network access layers
-only application, transport, network, data link, and physical layers
-application, session, transport, network, data link, and physical layers
#135. Refer to the exhibit. The IP address of which device interface should be used as the default gateway setting of host H1?
-R1: S0/0/0
-R2: S0/0/1
+R1: G0/0
-R2: S0/0/0
